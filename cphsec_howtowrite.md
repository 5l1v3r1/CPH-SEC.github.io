### <a id="Introduction"></a>Introduction

Its the dream to put Copenhagen and Danish white-hat hackers on the world map by creating solid content i.e. hacking guides for the CPH:SEC GitBook. 
This way both writers and readers can enjoy CPH:SEC hacking guides. High quality guides are in popular demand and so an initiative of corporation is needed.
This is the dream of the CPH:SEC GitBook project or put simply: **We will all like more hacking guides right?**
Using GitBook for hosting is a free, efficient and somewhat low-tech way to deliver content to readers and is easy to use for a linux user, hacker, programmer and works on all platforms.
Like Github, GitBook supports MarkDown  (MD) natively and so to make writing easy there is a CPH:SEC MD template.
